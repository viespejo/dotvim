  " create new preview split or switch to existing.
  "   vim has a Preview split which is a singleton,
  "   one per tab. This is perfect for repeated
  "   uses of the manual feature.
  " for some reason, I was getting errors
  " when trying to open a preview window.
  " but I'm unable to reproduce. Who knows...
  " try opening a new preview window.
  try
    exe 'pedit'

  " don't associate any file or swap file
  " with this buffer. http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip135
  " the first command automatically names
  " the buffer [Scratch]. We could use this
  " to reuse the scratch window.

  " 1. this was given by original author
  "    at http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/PHP_online_help
  "    Problem: doesn't search far enough down the page
  "    exe 'call search ("' . a:keyword .'")'
  " 2. I came up with this to remove stuff at top of
  "    file for function retrievals.
  "    Idea: search down to Description. Then go up 8 lines.
  "    Problem: doesn't work for non-function man pages.
  "    exe 'call search("Description")'
  "    exe 'norm 8kdgg'
  " 3. Best idea so far: search down to a really long underscore.
  "    This will be the search box if your underscore is short.
  "    If it's long enough, you'll match on the horizontal line
  "    that is above the definition we really want.
  exe 'call search("____________________________________")'
  exe 'norm dgg'
  " delete the user notes at the bottom. it's a lot of text,
  " and they are almost completely useless.
  exe 'call search("User Contributed Notes")'
  exe 'norm dGgg'

" manual lookup is mapped to ctrl-p
" ctrl-o is used to jump out of insert mode for one command.
" - jump out for one command <C-O>
" - call OpenPhpFunction with the word under cursor
" - CR seems to indicate end of fcn call
" - <C-O> again - we are in insert mode in the man page
" - this time, we jump back to previous window.
" - at the end of the day, we are still in insert mode,
"   the cursor is in exactly the same spot, and the man
"   page for php is visible
